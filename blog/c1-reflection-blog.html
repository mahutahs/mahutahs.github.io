    <h1>Thoughts on the "Time and management resources"</h1>
    <h2>Jan 17th, 2016</h2>
    <p>I think the EDA experience is very uplifting but to someone like mysef who isnt very confident with programming it is very intimidating.
    I think I have always been abit of a social butterfly so adapting to my surroundings is cool with me.
    I am intensely excited to be apart of this and cant wait to see whats waiting for us when its all over. i am also very nervous and very wary about time constraints but im willing to put in that extra effort and getting the mahi done.
