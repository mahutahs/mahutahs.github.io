    <h1>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h1>
    <h2>Jan 22nd, 2016</h2>
    <p> Okay so HTML is like building a house! all the code are pieces of the house coming together. CSS is like the paint / furniture it adds charather to the house. Where the DOM is like a translator, it allows the HTML and CSS to conmunicate with one another

  <h1>What is boxifying</h1>
  <p>Boxifying is the design process in realising that everything on the internet or atleast displayed on the internet is displayed in boxes.
    <br>
    Boxifying is taking the website design and adding all boxes around all possible programmed elements
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>What is the box Model</h1>
  <p>W3School.com said it best; "The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
