    <h1>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I found it alot more easier, There was more structure and flow to the process this time around</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I hadnt really thought too much about meditation prior to watching the video</p>
    <br>
    <h1>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>As stated earlier I had no prior experience with meditation, So this was quite the learning experience overall. I learnt alot</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>the Optimus Prime sitting posture. Seems to me to be the stereotypical meditation pose</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Any other musings?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I really enjoyed hearing the benefits of a clear and calm mind. I find it quite cool</p>
